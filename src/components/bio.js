          My name is Elisa Rose Vaccaro (if you couldn't have guessed from the
          bright lights above). I was born and raised in Cliffside Park, New
          Jersey, graduated from NYU in 2015 with a degree in Media, Culture and
          Communications and am an admitted realty TV junkie. Oh, and I'm also a
          graduate of The Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Development program.
          Which is probably why you're here.
        </p>
